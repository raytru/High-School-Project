            <h2 style="text-align:center">Market</h2>
            <p style="text-align:center"> Typically the products and services through illicit Dark Web marketplaces involve human trafficking; drugs; guns; social security or credit card numbers, chemical, biological materials and knowledge etc. For example firearms can be shipped to countries where buying these guns are difficult if not altogether banned by law coupled with the fact that these marketplaces are only visible to certain people who have access to
               specific software and authorizations, makes these illegal activities invisible. While the products being sold on these markets come from overseas, the number of illegal products being bought and sold domestically are increasing.

         <h2 style="text-align:center">Deepweb</h2>
         <p style="text-align:center"> The internet contains a vast plethora of information that isn't indexed by conventional search engines, that part of the web is known as the Deep Web. Further beyond that is the DarkNet which is a subset of the Deep Web, consisting of overlaying networks that uses public Internet but require distinctive software, configuration, or authorization to access. Which is generally used to hide the identity of the user and intentionally conceal content. The Dark web is predominantly used to conceal criminal or otherwise malicious activities. Anonymizing services which offer strong encryption such a Tor (The Onion Router) allows the exploitation of the Deep Web to conduct illegal and clandestine activities such as illegal transactions which are mainly purchased with digital currencies such as Bitcoin, an anonymous form of money that isn't tied to any banking institution.</p>

            Tor is US funded software which is used to conceal the user’s location and usage by directing the internet traffic and communications through a worldwide volunteer network of relays to encrypt the data from anyone conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis.
