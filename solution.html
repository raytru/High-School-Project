         <h2 style="text-align:center">Education program</h2>
         <p style="text-align:center"> A proposed solution is that the government should fund a training program designed to educate police officers about the Deepweb and Darknet.
            The police officers will explore the darknet itself and learn how it actually works. This education program will train current and future police officers about cyber crime
            and how to proctect their privacy. The more police officers who take this course the more trained and experienced law enforcement will be at confronting these illegal markets. A downside of
            this, is that this program requires funding in which they may not have especially if alot of police officers sign up. This program also has the potential to fail if not enough people join,
            It will also be hard to educate enough officers to the point that it makes a difference.

         <h2 style="text-align:center">Intercepting parcels (chosen)</h2>
         <p style="text-align:center"> Law enforcement agencies should cooperate and collaborate with parcel companies to examine suspicious packages, as this process
            is the most vulnerable part of the transaction due to the security stationed at air ports. Working closely with these companies will alow law enforcement to obtain tracking numbers
            in which they will track and eventually lead to the recipient.
